# Twitter Bootstrap Example Templates in Haml

A very simple [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) application where the example pages from the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) framework 
have been converted to [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/).

This is current as Bootstrap v1.4.0.

## Installation

```ruby
bundle install
rackup
```

You should now be able to view the application at [localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292).

The application uses the "hero" template. If you would like to use another template, use the appropriate `haml ...` line in app.rb.
